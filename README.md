# How it works
Heavily modified version of the "minature-rotary-phone" repo, demoing behaviours of Sheep, and Shark (a well known common enemy), aswell as exploring the themes of Sheep and their revernce of god.

We drove out to the Dublin mountains and took photos of wild life. These can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uMXFN536_LZ9J_W-HKQTxbd4fv9Z8X_I?usp=drive_link). We noticed that the sheep were elusive and hard to capture images of - this inspired by the "Escape" behaviour.

## Aidan Dowling (C20394933)
I did general project management / team leading and lead programming on this project. I abstracted the interactions of the boid classes to a parent class, reimplementing how those classes interact with eachother and the boid controller. I rewrote the boid controller to utilize dictionaries to manage different types of boids existing at the same time. This reduces unnecessary checks over boids which are irrelavant. I also reimplemented bucket based spatial hashing, which allows for more efficient boid neighbour detection. I added a sound system to the behaviours, which then determine if a sound is played by the sheep, with cooldowns and sounds from larger forces being chosen. I created the BoidInfometer which displays information about the boid you are looking at, such as its name, health, hunger and the current behaviours affecting it. I also wrote an original soundtrack for the game and recorded a cover for the main menu. The original sound track was heavily inspired by ambient electronic musicians (such as C418, Aphex Twin), and was recorded within Ableton.  

I am most proud of two things - the capable abstractions of boid's which allows dynamic interactions and the sound design and the audio system - music smoothly fades and loops, and sheeps have a dynamic sound effects depending on the behaviour exhibited.

I learned a lot about writing code within Godot and its unique paradigms. I learned how to do audio in Godot and mixing audio for games. I learned a huge amount about boid behaviours and the process of implementing those things in a collaborative environment. 

## Aleksey (C20402732)
I did the bulk of the model creation for the project. This was done due to me having the most modeling experience out of the group. This included creating the low-poly models, texturing them, rigging them and animating them. After this was done i worked on implementing the moving godsheep. This gave a way for the sheep to reproduce and to be blessed if the shepard was well behaved. 

I am most proud of two things - the look and feel of the enviroment and the un-natural feeling of the moving godsheep

I broadened by knowledge in using blender as i had never done animation before, learning about keyframing and how to output these animations into godot.
